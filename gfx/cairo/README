Snapshots of cairo and libpixman for mozilla usage.  Where possible,
these should be official releases from the cairo project as-is.  If
changes are necessary, they should be documented below and the patch
file included in this directory.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo 1.0.2

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 cannot build pixman correctly for various reasons.  There is a static
win32 pixman library provided in libpixman/src/pixman-vc71.lib that will
be used instead of building on all Win32/Visual C++ builds.  Building with
VC7.1, gcc/mingw, or anything else other than VC6 is fine.

To build with VC7: create a new empty static library project.  Set
optimization appropriately (/Ox).  In the Librarian->General project config
section, set /NODEFAULTLIB, and add "LIBCMT.LIB, MSVCRT.LIB" to the list of
libraries to ignore.  The resulting .lib should link cleanly with a VC6
firefox.

***** Note about OS/2 *****

The files cairo-os2-private.h, cairo-os2-surface.c, and cairo-os2.h and the
line @OS2_SURFACE_FEATURE@ in cairo-features.h.in are not part of upstream
cairo 1.0.x and so were added in the Mozilla tree. Do not overwrite them.
